## I. In a nutshell: Make it easy to use

Goal: What is this about?

### What is REST

- Representational State Transfer
- Resource Oriented Architecture
  - Query string parameters
  - You are performing an action on some resource
- Simpler than Remote Procedure Calls
  - RPC: You send a command for server to run a snippet of code

### REST vs Big Web Services

- REST / HTTP handle simple jobs very well
- Big Web Services handle distributed complicated problems very well
- Don't over complicate: Use HTTP if you can
