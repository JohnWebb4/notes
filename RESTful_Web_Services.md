## I. In a nutshell: Make it easy to use

Goal: What is this about?

### What is REST

- Representational State Transfer
- Resource Oriented Architecture
  - Query string parameters
  - You are performing an action on some resource
- Simpler than Remote Procedure Calls
  - RPC: You send a command for server to run a snippet of code

### REST vs Big Web Services

- REST / HTTP handle simple jobs very well
- Big Web Services handle distributed complicated problems very well
- Don't over complicate: Use HTTP if you can

## 1. General Web

Goal: General Web Services

Programmable web: It runs code
Web is mainly HTML, XML, JavaScript

### HTTP Protocal Sender

- Method: What you want to do (GET, POST, etc.)
- Path: Relative to website what endpoint are you hitting
- Header: Extra metadata you send
- Body: Any information you are sending

### HTTP Protocol Response

- Code: Server response code (404, etc.)
- Header: Extra metadata you send
- Body: Any information you are sending

### REST vs SOAP

#### SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol

- Async communication protocal
- Less plumbing (tunnelling, security, etc.)
- Complex operations work well
- Can communicate through HTTP, SMTP, etc.
- XMl Formatting in body

#### REST: Reprentational State Transfer

- You are querying/modifying state on server
- Handles simple very well
- Endpoint describes object: PUT www.url.com/name

### RPC: Remote Procedure Call

- Format for encoding data
- Often inside HTTP envelope
- Often XML-RPC
- You are running a command on the server
- Endpoint describes action: www.url.com/name/rename

## 2. Intro Web Service Clients

Goal: Introduction to RESTful client?

- Implementing a hybrid RPC is very straightforward
  - Use HTTP libraries, XML libraries, and create endpoints

### Considerations for RESTful Services

- Supporting proxies (Most libraries by default)
- Caching common request responses
- Handling re-directs well
- Handle headers and authorization

### Basic Guidelines

- Always enfore the param types and number of them
- User curl to test endpoints

### Examples

- Java, PHP, C# all use SAX style XML parser (Simple API for XML)
- JavaScript XMLHTTPOnRequest handles it for your

### JSON vs XML

- JSON represents objects well
- XML / HTML represents documents well

## 3. REST Web Service Clients

## 4. REST Architecture

Goal: Practical REST architecture

## 5. Write REST Endpoints

Goal: How do you write REST endpoints?

## 6. REST Services

Goal: Extending REST endpoints.

## 7. REST Service Example

Goal: Converting to turly RESTful server

## 8. REST and ROA Best Practices

Goal: Recap / When to use REST

## 9. The Building Blocks of Services

Goal: Extending REST

## 10. Comparing REST with Big Web Services

Goal: Compare / Contrast REST with alternatives

## 11. How AJAX works into REST

Goal: How Ajax aligns with REST

## 12. REST Framworks

Goal: Implementing REST with Frameworks
